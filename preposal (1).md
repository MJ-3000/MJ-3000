# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I want to create a wordle-type website, I will add new requirements like a timer or features of different levels where instead of a five letter word it could be a six letter
word. If that doesn't work I would do a game but i don't know what kind of game I would do.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan on collaborating with anyone at the moment.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If I make a wordle type game would I have to say another name instead of wordle?
