# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Wordie Games

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you guess a five letter word

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a web game, using HTML and CSS, to code a Wordle clone. Initially the user will guess a five letter word, if everything goes to plan and I have enough time I will add levels or even a timer to add some complexity.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

What I will accomplish no matter what is a wordle clone that allows you to guess a five letter word

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be, if I could have rounds/levels where if you guess the five letter word correclty you can then gues a six letter word and so on. I would also like there to maybe be a timer to add a level of difficulty, and the further you go in levels the lower the timer gets.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to finish my project the way I visualize it in my head. I also hope I will be the best project so that I can skip out on the final exam.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will watch tutorials on how to make a wordle clone, learn about the syntax and the basics of HTML and CSS because I don't have prior knowledge in those languages.
